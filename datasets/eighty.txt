80 (eighty) is the natural number following 79 and preceding 81. 80 is: the sum of Euler's totient function φ(x) over the first sixteen integers. a semiperfect number, since adding up some subsets of its divisors (e.g., 1, 4, 5, 10, 20 and 40) gives 80. a ménage number. palindromic in bases 3 (22223), 6 (2126), 9 (889), 15 (5515), 19 (4419) and 39 (2239). a repdigit in bases 3, 9, 15, 19 and 39. The Pareto principle (also known as the 80-20 rule) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Every solvable configuration of the 15 puzzle can be solved in no more than 80 single-tile moves.
