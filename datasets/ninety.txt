90 (ninety) is the natural number preceded by 89 and followed by 91. In the English language, the numbers 90 and 19 are often confused, as they sound very similar. When carefully enunciated, they differ in which syllable is stressed: 19 /naɪnˈtiːn/ vs 90 /ˈnaɪnti/. However, in dates such as 1999, and when contrasting numbers in the teens and when counting, such as 17, 18, 19, the stress shifts to the first syllable: 19 /ˈnaɪntiːn/. 90 is: a unitary perfect number because it is the sum of its unitary divisors (excluding itself). a semiperfect number because it is equal to the sum of a subset of its divisors. a pronic number. a nontotient. a Perrin number, preceded in the sequence by 39, 51, 68. a Harshad number since 90 is divisible by the sum of its base 10 digits. In normal space, the interior angles of a rectangle measure 90 degrees each. Also, in a right triangle, the angle opposing the hypotenuse measures 90 degrees, with the other two angles adding up to 90 for a total of 180 degrees. Thus, an angle measuring 90 degrees is called a right angle.
