70 (seventy) is the natural number following 69 and preceding 71. 70 is: a sphenic number because it factors as 3 distinct primes. a Pell number. the seventh pentagonal number. the fourth tridecagonal number. the fifth pentatope number. the number of ways to choose 4 objects out of 8 if order does not matter. This makes it a central binomial coefficient. the smallest weird number, a natural number that is abundant but not semiperfect. a palindromic number in bases 9 (779), 13 (5513) and 34 (2234). a Harshad number in bases 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16. an Erdős–Woods number, since it is possible to find sequences of 70 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member. The sum of the first 24 squares starting from 1 is 702. This relates 70 to the Leech lattice and thus string theory.
